Subject: [PATCH 2/8] resolv: res_query for CNAMEs

From: http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/uclibc/2009-June/042583.html

I had postfix failing for domains with MX->CNAME->A chain. In glibc it works.
I tracked it to be a problem in uclibc res_query. It returns bogus data
for CNAME entries, apparently intentionally, which is wrong.

glibc return CNAME entries even for CNAME queries and most applications rely
on this. So we should do the same in uclibc.
