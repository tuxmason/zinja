Description: a lossless data compressor
 Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to
 the one of gzip or bzip2.
 .
 Lzip can compress about as fast as gzip (lzip -0), or compress most
 files more than bzip2 (lzip -9). Decompression speed is intermediate
 between gzip and bzip2.
 .
 Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective.
